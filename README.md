## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery

Collaborating with Alec on his small business website has been a rewarding experience. While the project is temporarily on hold due to financial constraints, Alec has been a proactive contributor, providing valuable resources such as well-crafted copy, high-quality images, and an eye-catching logo.

Upon landing on the website, visitors are greeted with the VoltX logo, prominently displayed above the business name. A compelling yet temporary slogan and clear call-to-action buttons guide users toward their intended actions. Notably, the call-to-action buttons feature an engaging glowing hover effect transitioning smoothly between yellow and blue. User-friendly navigation is facilitated by a jQuery-powered right-sided menu bar, enabling seamless scrolling to various sections of the site. As users scroll down, they encounter informative sections about Alec and his business, including a comprehensive "About Us" and "Core Competencies" section. Additionally, an embedded custom Google Maps service area enhances the user experience.

The "Services" section offers a wide array of services provided by Alec, providing potential clients with a comprehensive overview of what his business offers. The inclusion of a well-designed standard contact form caters to various business needs. Furthermore, the footer presents an abundance of essential components, including links to social media profiles and accepted payment methods, consolidating vital information into a convenient, one-stop destination for users.

## Optimizations

While the project remains incomplete due to financial constraints, opportunities for optimization can be explored once the site is finalized. Performance tests can be conducted to identify areas for improvement and refinement.

## Lessons Learned:

Working alongside Alec has been a positive and adaptable journey. Flexibility in meeting each client's unique requirements is a hallmark of our approach. We look forward to the opportunity to continue collaborating with Alec when the circumstances permit, further enhancing the site and its impact on his small business.
